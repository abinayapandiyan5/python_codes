**A. Python is an indent based programming language**

**The following program throws an indentation error. Correct it and make sure it prints properly.**



teams = \['Data', 'AI', 'DevOps']

for t in teams:

print('Hello', t, 'Team from Inceptez Technologies')

&#x20; print('Keep Learning and Exploring!')



Sol:

====

teams = \['Data', 'AI', 'DevOps']

for t in teams:

&#x20;   print('Hello', t, 'Team from Inceptez Technologies')

print('Keep Learning and Exploring!')









**B. Commented line in Python**

**Use Case 1:**

**Add single-line and multi-line comments to describe what the below code does for Inceptez Technologies’ training tracker.**



students = 100

trainers = 2

total = students + trainers

print(total)



Sol:

====

\# Students and trainers count of inceptez

students = 100

trainers = 2

total = students + trainers

print(total)





**Use Case 2:**

**Convert the below block into a “dead code” using comments, then re-activate it later to print**



print("Welcome to Inceptez Python Learning")



Sol:

====

'''print("Welcome to Inceptez Python Learning")'''

print('''"Welcome to Inceptez Python Learning"''')





**C. Playing with Quotes**

**Use Case 1:**

**Create three string variables that correctly store and print:**



This is Inceptez's "Python" class for Data Engineers \& AI Engineers

→ Use single, double, and triple quotes appropriately.



Sol:

====

var1 = "This is Inceptez's"

var2 = '"Python" class for'

var3 = "Data Engineers \& AI Engineers"

print(var1, var2, var3)





**Use Case 2:**

**Write a multiline string using triple quotes that prints:**



Welcome to Inceptez Technologies!

Python Training: Basics

Enjoy your learning journey.



Sol:

====

var1 = """Welcome to Inceptez Technologies!

Python Training: Basics

Enjoy your learning journey."""

print(var1)









**D. Let's learn all about VARIABLES**

**Use Case 1:**

Declare variables to store the following details:

\- Student Name

\- Course Name (e.g., “Python Fundamentals”)

\- Training Institute Name (Inceptez Technologies)



Then print a formatted message:



Name: Arun is learning the course Python Fundamentals at the institute Inceptez Technologies



Sol:

====

stu\_name = "Arun"

course\_name = "Python Fundamentals"

institute\_name = "Inceptez Technologies"

print(stu\_name,'is learning the course',course\_name,'at the institute',institute\_name)







**Use Case 2:**

Demonstrate dynamic inference, dynamic typing using with fee by applying .18 gst  and prove strongly typing character also by operating it with Eighteen percent gst



fee = 45000



Sol:

====

\# Dynamic inference

fee = 45000

print(type(fee))

gst = 0.18

print(type(gst))





\# Dynamic typing

fee = 45000

print(type(fee))

fee = fee \* 0.18

print(type(fee))





\#strongly typed

fee = 'Hundred'

gst = 0.18

print(fee + gst)





**E. Variables Naming Conventions**

**Use Case 1:**

Identify which variable names below are invalid for Inceptez’s student database:



1\) 2student = 'Ravi'

2\) \_student\_id = 1001

3\) studentName = 'Priya'

4\) class name = 'Python'

5\) inceptez\_batch = 'Morning'



Sol:

====



1\) 2student = 'Ravi'  #invalid

2\) \_student\_id = 1001 #valid

3\) studentName = 'Priya' #valid

4\) class name = 'Python' #invalid

5\) inceptez\_batch = 'Morning' #valid





**Use Case 2:**

Declare 3 variables following naming styles for Inceptez projects:



PascalCase: DataEngineeringBatch

camelCase: dataEngineeringBatch

snake\_case: data\_engineering\_batch



Sol:

===



StudentName = "Abinaya"

courseName  = "Data engineering"

institute\_name = "Inceptez"
